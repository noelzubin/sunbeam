# V2 Changes

## Manifest

There is a new `actions` field in the manifest. Each action appears as a list item in the sunbeam homepage.

```json
{
    "title": "My extension",
    "actions": [
        { "title": "Say hello", "type": "run", "command": "say-hello" },
        { "title": "Say hello to b-per", "type": "run", "command": "say-hello", "params": { "name": "b-per" } },
        { "title": "Open Sunbeam Repo", "type": "open", "target": "https://github.com/pomdtr/sunbeam" },
    ],
    "commands": [
        {
            "name": "say-hello",
            "mode": "detail",
            "params": [
                { "name": "name", "type": "string" }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

It means that you can have an extension contributing no root items, or multiple root items for a single command.

You can also create snippets / quicklinks thanks to `open` and `copy` actions.

## Command Mode

There are for type of command modes:

- `filter`: same as before
- `search`: same as before
- `detail`: same as before
- `action`: return an action. Useful to copy a dynamic string to the clipboard (ex: `copy random uuid`)
- `silent`: run a command, then exit

## Simplified actions spec

The pool of actions has been simplified to 3: `run`, `open`, and `copy`.

```json
{ "title": "Copy Example Text", "type": "copy", "text": "example-text" }
{ "title": "Open Example URL", "type": "open", "target": "https://example.com"}
{ "title": "Run Example Command", "type": "run", "command": "example-command", "params": {"example": true} }
```

The `shortcut`, `reload` and `exit` properties have been dropped.
